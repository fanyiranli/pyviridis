### Reference

---

The R package `viridis` was created by Simon Garnier, if you want to know more about this original package, you can go to his [github](https://github.com/sjmgarnier).

The color maps `viridis`, `magma`, `inferno`, and `plasma` were created by Stéfan van der Walt ([@stefanv](https://github.com/stefanv)) and Nathaniel Smith ([@njsmith](https://github.com/njsmith)). If you want to know more about the science behind the creation of these color maps, you can watch this [presentation of `viridis`](https://youtu.be/xAoljeRJ3lU) by their authors at [SciPy 2015](https://scipy2015.scipy.org/).

The color map `cividis` is a corrected version of 'viridis', developed by Jamie R. Nuñez, Christopher R. Anderton, and Ryan S. Renslow, and originally ported to `R` by Marco Sciaini ([@msciain](https://github.com/marcosci)). More info about `cividis` can be found in [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0199239).

The color maps `mako` and `rocket` were originally created for the `Seaborn` statistical data visualization package for Python. More info about `mako` and `rocket` can be found on the [`Seaborn` website](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html).

The color map `turbo` was developed by Anton Mikhailov to address the shortcomings of the Jet rainbow color map such as false detail, banding and color blindness ambiguity. More infor about `turbo` can be found [here](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/turbo-improved-rainbow-colormap-for.html).
